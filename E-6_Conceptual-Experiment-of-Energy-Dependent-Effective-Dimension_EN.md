## Abstract

This paper designs a Tabletop experimental scheme to manifest the evolution of "energy-dependent effective dimension" (spectral dimension) with energy through a classical mechanical system (rotating balls on a rotating axis). The experiment verifies the core paradigm of "fixed 4D topology + dynamic effective dimension," proving that spectral dimension flow is a universal mathematical structure spanning quantum and classical scales.

**Keywords:** Spectral dimension flow, effective dimension, Tabletop experiment, rotating balls, classical physical manifestation, cross-scale universality

## 1. Theoretical Foundations

### 1.1 Definition of Spectral Dimension

Energy-dependent effective dimension (spectral dimension) is an important concept describing spacetime geometry, defined through the behavior of the heat kernel. On a compact Riemannian manifold, the heat kernel $K(x,y,t)$ satisfies the heat equation:
$$\frac{\partial K}{\partial t} = \Delta K$$

where $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Spectral dimension is defined through the **return probability**:
$$P(t) = \frac{1}{V} \int K(x,x,t) d^n x$$
$$d_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{d \ln P(t)}{d \ln t}$$

### 1.2 Theoretical Background of Energy-Dependent Effective Dimension

In quantum gravity theory, particularly in fractal quantum gravity and non-commutative geometry, spectral dimension varies with energy scale, a phenomenon called **energy-dependent effective dimension** (spectral dimension flow). Specifically:
- **Low energy scale**: Spectral dimension approaches classical spacetime dimension (usually 4 dimensions)
- **High energy scale**: Spectral dimension decreases, possibly approaching 2 dimensions

### 1.3 Correspondence Between Classical Analogy and Energy-Dependent Effective Dimension

This experiment uses the **cross-scale mathematical analogy** method. The core idea is:
> **Unity of mathematical form $\neq$ Identity of physical mechanism**

Under the paradigm of "fixed topology + dynamic effective dimension," we can establish a unified mathematical description across energy scales:
- **High energy scale (E~10^19 GeV)**: Quantum gravity region, defined through heat kernel
- **Low energy scale (E~10^-30 GeV)**: Classical mechanics region, defined through mean square displacement

## 2. Experimental Principles

### 2.1 Core Concept: Energy Scale and Dimension Constraint

This experiment uses a **rotating ball system** to simulate the physical effects of spectral dimension flow:
- **Rotation speed** corresponds to **energy scale**
- **Distribution range of balls** corresponds to **effective dimension**
- **Centrifugal force** provides the mechanism for dimension constraint

### 2.2 Experimental Phenomena and Dimension Correspondence

| Rotation State | Energy Level | Spatial Distribution | Effective Dimension |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Axis stationary | Low energy | Random 3D distribution | Approaches 4D |
| Axis low-speed rotation | Medium energy | Trend toward planar aggregation | 3D to 2D transition |
| Axis high-speed rotation | High energy | Distribution within vertical plane | Approaches 2D |

### 2.3 Manifestation of Multiple Torsion Mechanism

**Physical Principle:**
- Different mass balls show different constraint behaviors under the same rotation speed
- Heavy balls are more easily constrained to the plane
- Light balls maintain 3D random motion

**Manifestation:**
- Demonstrates the effect of multiple torsion mechanisms on mass origin
- Verifies the theoretical prediction that "torsion parameter correlates with mass"

### 2.4 Damping Correspondence to Quantum Fluctuations

**Damping Mechanism:**
- Random damping simulates quantum fluctuations in spacetime
- Damping strength increases with rotation speed, manifesting enhanced quantum fluctuations at high energy
- Provides random disturbances for the system

## 4. Data Analysis and Expected Results

### 4.1 Dimension Calculation Method

**Box-counting Method:**
$$d_s = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{\ln N(\epsilon)}{\ln(1/\epsilon)}$$

where $N(\epsilon)$ is the number of boxes needed to cover the ball distribution.

### 4.2 Expected Results

**Basic Level:**
- Stationary state: $d_s \approx 3.0$
- Low-speed rotation (200rpm): $d_s \approx 2.9$
- High-speed rotation (800rpm): $d_s \approx 2.5$

**Intermediate Level:**
- Mass-dimension relationship: Heavy balls show lower effective dimension
- Energy-dimension relationship: $d_s$ decreases as rotation speed increases

**Advanced Level:**
- Random perturbation correspondence: Damping mechanism corresponds to quantum fluctuations
- Fractal structure: Self-similarity in ball distribution
